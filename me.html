									<h1>About<br />
									Me</h1>
									<p>I am a recent university graduate from UNSW who possesses a strong foundation of <br />
										statistical, analytical and mathematical knowledge ascribable to my economic background, <br />
									 leveraging both my technical and detail-oriented skills<br />
									 to persevere in any given environment.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/code_sample.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>As an autonomous and diligent individual aspiring to enter the Data Science industry and thrive as a Data Analyst, the first door to my journey. I am ardent to fulfil the obligatory duties and complete the necessary tasks the jobs entail, whilst additionally developing a strong relationship with the company and the people within.</p>
								<p> With the completion of my undergraduate degree in Economics at UNSW, I have become well versed with the nuances within the field of data analytics, with particular emphasis on the statistical and mathematical layers, skills that are essential to excelling as a data analyst. I moreover possess a rigid foundation of knowledge on database management systems, data visualisation tools and programming languages such as Python and SQL; all learnt through extensive self-study.</p>
								<p> Previous work experience at Siva Projects utilising MS Excel to complete tender evaluations accentuates my ability to perform analytically in a work environment whilst also allowing me to hone my observational and deductive skills. I take pride in my ability to take raw data and transform it into actionable solutions, making it accessible for executive decision. Despite my dearth of data analysis work experience, I am determined to fully commit and dedicate myself to learning the ropes of the job, to satiate any inexperience I may have.   </p>
								<p> Having undergone the core econometric courses in my BEco degree, they acted as the catalyst that led me down a pathway into data analysis, diverging myself away from traditional economics/finance graduate jobs. Discovering the vast depth of the data analytics industry and the power statistics and well-presented data can have in manoeuvring peopleâ€™s viewpoints, further enkindled my interest. The narratives that are tethered to data to communicate insights also supplemented my intrigue and enabled me to fully gauge the journey data can take.   </p>
								<p> It is my goal to work as a Data Analyst and I believe that this is the stepping stone for my future. In return I plan to be a valuable asset to your team. Thank you for taking the time to look over my portfolio.  </p>
